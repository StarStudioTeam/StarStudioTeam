# About Me - Charlotte

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub! My name is Charlotte, and I'm a soft-spoken, kind, and curious human being. I appreciate your visit, and I'd like to take a moment to share a little about myself.

## Who Am I?

I'm just your average person navigating life, with all its ups and downs. I'm passionate about many things, but above all, I value kindness and curiosity. You'll often find me exploring various topics and interests on GitHub.

## My Journey

I'm currently in the midst of a unique and challenging journey. Throughout my second game, you'll learn that my illness is taking a toll on me. However, I tend to downplay my symptoms and keep quiet about them. It's not that I'm trying to be secretive, but rather, I don't want to burden others or cause unnecessary worry.

## A Glimpse Into My Struggles

In the second game, it becomes evident that I may be dealing with anxiety, and I also take antipsychotic medication for another undisclosed illness. It's a personal battle that I face daily, and I do my best to manage it while continuing to learn, grow, and contribute to the GitHub community.

I take pills to help manage my anxiety, especially after socializing, but when it comes to the other medications, I have my reasons for refusing them. My hope is that through sharing my story here on GitHub, I can raise awareness, foster understanding, and let others facing similar challenges know that they're not alone.

## Connect With Me

I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals, fellow developers, or anyone interested in the projects I'm working on. Feel free to reach out, and let's explore the world of coding and collaboration together.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to our journey together on GitHub.
